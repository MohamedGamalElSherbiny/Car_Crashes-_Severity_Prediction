# Car Crashes' Severity Prediction

## Get Started:

It's simple. You are given information about the environment of the car crash and you're required to predict the severity of the crash out of 4 level. The predictive system is already built but it needs some data of good quality. You need to prepare the dataset and train the prediction systems. 
This predictive system will be helpful to anticipate the resources to engage by San Francisco Municipality depending on its severity.

### Rules: 

This competitions is part of the ITI's AI-Pro training program. In order to have your submission considered in the final evaluation you must follow these rules.

* All submissions must be made through notebooks that show ALL the steps taken in order to generate this submission.

* Changes in the model are NOT allowed. This includes, but not limited to, changing the model type and/or changing any of the current model's parameters.

* You are NOT allowed to upload processed data to your submission notebook. For example, you CANNOT prepare the data using Orange and upload the prepared data for the model to be directly trained on. All the data preparation steps must be in the notebook. However, you can use any tool, e.g., Orange, to learn more about the data and/or make decisions BUT YOU'LL NEED TO WRITE YOUR FINAL DECISIONS IN PYTHON IN THE SUBMISSION NOTEBOOK.

* Discussions with other teams are allowed ONLY through the Discussion Tab in the competitions.

* It's required that you make your notebook public AFTER the end date of the competition. This allows the organizers to validate the work done and make sure that the order of the participants in the leaderboard reflects the work done by the team. The final leaderboard will be published after organizers review of the submissions' notebooks.
